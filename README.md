In this data analyst project with Excel, this project is how to preprocess data in Excel and changed them to our preferred data types. Furthermore, we have  created pivot tables and build charts and maps from them. In addition, we have design the structure and background of  dashboard and added charts and maps into the dashboard. Finally, we have used  filter function and slicers to make dashboard interactive.
Make the above points more creative to add in GIT.
